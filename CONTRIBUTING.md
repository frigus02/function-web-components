# Contributing

From opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is appreciated and welcome. If you're planning to implement a new feature or change an API please create an issue first. This way we can ensure that your precious work is not in vain.

## Process

1. Fork, then clone the repository.

1. Create a new branch based on master and start to make your changes.
